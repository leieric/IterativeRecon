{"improvement": "The latest iteration has made significant progress by adding figures around the campfire and adjusting the nighttime background. However, the figures appear too cartoonish compared to the realistic style of the reference image. Also, the Milky Way needs to be more pronounced and the horizontal alignment of the background (e.g., the sky gradient and sea) requires better integration with the foreground. The fire in IMAGE-TO-IMAGE MODEL OUTPUT Y needs to have more vibrant and lively flames to match REFERENCE IMAGE X.", "prompt": "Create a realistic scene of people around a campfire on a beach at night with detailed flames, enhanced Milky Way in the sky, and seamless integration of the sea and sky gradient in the backdrop, aiming for lifelike human figures and natural coloring.", "score": "3"}
