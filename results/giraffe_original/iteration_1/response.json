{"improvement": "The REFERENCE IMAGE X shows two giraffes in a more detailed and vast savannah landscape with varied vegetation including bushes and sparse trees. The IMAGE-TO-IMAGE MODEL OUTPUT Y also portrays two giraffes but the background is rather blurry and lacks detailed vegetation and the giraffes are positioned in a symmetrical face-to-face manner which is different from the slightly angled positioning in REFERENCE IMAGE X. The color and lighting of the savannah need adjustment to match the more vibrant and natural tones of REFERENCE IMAGE X.", "prompt": "Adjust two giraffes standing in a natural savannah, add detailed mixed vegetation including bushes and sparse trees, position giraffes slightly angled, enhance background clarity, and improve savannah color to vibrant natural tones.", "score": "3"}
