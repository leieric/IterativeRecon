{"improvement": "The reference image features a campfire on a dark beach with a hilly background and the night sky visible. The current output image includes a bright, wide-spreading campfire with a visible starry sky and a slight reflection on a placid lake, set against a serene mountain backdrop. To improve, adjust the scene to be at night with a darker, more secluded setting. Reduce the brightness and expansion of the fire, and depict it with fewer embers. Show the fire situated on a darker, sandier beach rather than grass.", "prompt": "Transform scene to a darker, secluded beach at night with a small, less bright campfire surrounded by dark hills and a dimly visible night sky, minimal star visibility, no grass.", "score": "3"}
