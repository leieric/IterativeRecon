Specifically, the stars and night sky need to be clearer and filled with visible stars, while the fire needs a gentler, softer glow with perhaps a hint of smoke rising above it. The foreground should include the lakeside setting with more of a grassy layer close to the fire.", "prompt": "Increase star visibility in the night sky, add grass near the fire in the foreground and soften the glow of the fire with slight smoke above it.", "score": "3"}
