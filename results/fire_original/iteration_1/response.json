{"improvement": "The reference image X shows a night scene with a lakeshore bonfire, with gentle flames and darkness around. The output image Y has a much brighter, slightly unrealistic fire glow and the stars are overly visible and foggy. The fire's glow needs to be toned down and the scene darkened overall for a more subtle nighttime effect. The stars should be less pronounced and clearer, and the silhouette of hills in the background must be more visible.", "prompt": "Create a subtle nighttime scene with a lakeside bonfire emitting gentle, less bright flames. Darken the overall environment to enhance the night effect, make stars less pronounced and clearer, and ensure the silhouette of distant hills is more visible.", "score": "3"}
