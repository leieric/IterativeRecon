{"improvement": "The reference image features a more illuminated and dynamic fire, set on a shore with a darker and more detailed surrounding, under a twilight sky. The output image contains brighter surroundings, a proportionally smaller and less intense fire, and unrealistic starry sky. To improve similarity, adjust to a bigger and brighter fire closer to the viewer, reduce grass details, and create a darker, more realistic twilight sky without stars.", "prompt": "Adjust fire to be larger and brighter, bring fire closer, diminish grass detail and brighten it slightly, use a darker twilight sky without stars, employ a more realistic campfire setting on a shore.", "score": "5"}
