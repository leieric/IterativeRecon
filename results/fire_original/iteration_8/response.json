{"improvement": "The current image has a fire at night with a dark and largely indistinct background. The reference image shows a night scene with a brighter, star-filled sky and detailed landscapes visible around the fire. The fire in the reference image is more controlled and smaller in size compared to the large, wild flames in the output image. The background needs a clear view of a starry night sky, maintaining landscape details such as hills and lake clearly visible in the night light.", "prompt": "Transform the fire to have smaller, more controlled flames on beach sand near a lake under a star-filled night sky with visible distant hills and grass around. Brighten the overall scene to reveal landscape details.", "score": "3"}
