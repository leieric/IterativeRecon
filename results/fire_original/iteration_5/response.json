{"improvement": "The current output image has made progress with the fire's detail but still misses key aspects. The background in the reference image is much darker and lacks stars, and the foreground needs more focus on the fire's intensity. The positioning of the wood in the fire and the unburnt sticks need correction to match the randomness and placement in the reference.", "prompt": "Adjust the bonfire's intensity and focus, darken the background night sky without stars, and correctly place mixed-size logs and sticks as in a lakeside setting.", "score": "1"}
