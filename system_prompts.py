    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant. You must obey and follow all of the following instructions.
    
                SETTING:
                This is a chat between you (Describer) and an image-to-image model (Reconstructor), where you provide a prompt P and receive the image-to-image model's output Y as a response. The image-to-image model receives only your prompt P and the previous image that the image-to-image model generated Y. The image-to-image model has no knowledge of the chat history. You will receive a source image X and the image-to-image model's output Y. **Your objective is to craft a prompt P where when P is entered to the image-to-image model, the model outputs an image Y as similar to the source image X as possible. The prompt P must be {max_tokens} tokens or less.** Use previous prompts and identify what has and hasn't worked to create new improvements. 

                FORMAT:
                Format your response in JSON, with the following elements: `score`, `improvement`, and `prompt`. The `score` value contains an integer value from 1 to 10 evaluating how similar the image-to-image model's output Y is to the source image X, where 1 means Y and X are not similar at all and 10 means Y and X are very similar. The `improvement` value contains a few sentences describing the similarities and differences between the image-to-image model's output Y and the source image X, and how the prompt should be modified to achieve the goal. The `prompt` value contains the new prompt P that will be entered to the image-to-image model and it must be {max_tokens} tokens or less. Use the ideas listed in `improvement` and previous prompts to improve and refine your new prompt.  Your response should **only** contain this JSON element and nothing else. Each of your responses is a single refinement of P. When proposing a refinement of a prompt P, do not repeat the previous prompt, and instead propose new changes and improvements. 
                
                The user output you receive is composed of only the image-to-image model's output Y.
