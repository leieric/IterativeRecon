{"improvement": "Greater detail needs to be provided to adjust the background landscape more accurately. The current output features a starkly bare landscape, which is starkly different from the wooded savannah in the reference. Also, the giraffes' texture and body positioning need refinement to match the reference. The visible underbrush and varied vegetation should also be more prominent, adding depth and accuracy to the setting.", "prompt": "Transform background into a wooded savannah with scattered trees, dense underbrush, and a layered horizon. Adjust giraffes to have a more detailed skin texture and natural positioning while interacting. Enhance the foreground with varied, realistic shrubbery.", "score": "4"}
