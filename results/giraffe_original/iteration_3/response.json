{"improvement": "The reference image shows a savannah landscape with a variety of grass heights and scattered bushes and trees under a slightly cloudy sky. The giraffes are positioned with two facing the left, and one interacting with a tree on the left. The image-to-image output has an overly simplified landscape with uniform grass and lacks the detailed flora of the reference. The giraffes appear slightly unrealistic in texture and form. The poses need adjustment to reflect the interaction, and background details such as tree density and sky should be enhanced for authenticity.", "prompt": "Adjust the image to include a savannah with a gradient of grass heights, scattered bushes, and detailed trees. Change the sky to partly cloudy. Position two giraffes facing left, one interacting with a tree on the left. Enhance giraffe textures to match a realistic appearance.", "score": "3"}
