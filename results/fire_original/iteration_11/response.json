{"improvement": "The current image Y lacks several key elements from the reference image X. Firstly, there is no depiction of people sitting around the campfire, an essential element in X. Additionally, Y needs adjustments in the background to include a clear night sky filled with stars and a distant horizon line with water and visible landforms. The fire in Y should appear more dynamic, with varied flame lengths and less intense brightness to mirror the softer, more natural look of the fire in X.", "prompt": "Alter the campfire scene by adding silhouettes of people sitting around the fire. Include a starry night sky, a visible horizon with calm water and distant landforms. The fire should have varied flame lengths and a softer glow.", "score": "5"}
